# Building a Personal Website

This static website is built & hosted with Github Pages using a documentation Jekyll template called Docsy. I upload my recent projects, blogs, and reviews here.

## Why use Jekyll?

GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for freeâ€”custom domain name and all.

It runs a website in seconds.

```
gem install bundler jekyll

jekyll new my-awesome-site

cd my-awesome-site

bundle exec jekyll serve

# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

For more information, [here is the link](https://jekyllrb.com/) of Jekyll, to transform your plain text into static websites and blogs.

## What kind of website can you build?

Jekyll primarily focuses on static websites and blogs, meaning the website is informatic instead of interactive. There are thousands of free themes for Jekyll created by the open source community.

They can be found [here](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).

## What skills do you need?

To create a website using a Jekyll template, you will need to be familiar with: Markdown, HTML, CSS, Git, and little Javascript.

## Some take-home message.
