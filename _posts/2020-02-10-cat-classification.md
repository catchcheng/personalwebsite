In this assignment, I built an L-layer deep neural network for image classification. For here, L can be any integer greater than 0. In this case, I picked L as 5 and achieved training accuracy as 100% and test accuracy as 84% to differentiate cat and non-cat images.
Here is the representation of an L-layer deep neural network.

The general deep learning methodology to build the model is as the following:

<ol>
<li>Initialize parameters / Define hyperparameters</li>
<li>Loop for num_iterations:</li>
<ul>
       <li>Forward propagation</li>
       <li>Compute cost function</li>
       <li>Backward propagation</li>
       <li>Update parameters (using parameters, and grads from backprop)</li><br>
</ul>
<li>Use trained parameters to predict labels</li>
</ol>
   
Here is the output of the cross-entropy cost after 2400 iterations.

The 5-layer neural network has test accuracy (84%) than your 2-layer neural network (72%) on the same test set.

Here is an example testing with a cat image.
