This practical application of deep learning is built using programming frameworks, which have many built-in functions I can simply call.

The model I built here is the model:Â CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED.
Here are the following parameters for all the steps in detail:

- Conv2D: stride 1, padding is "SAME"
- ReLU
- Max pool: Use an 8 by 8 filter size and an 8 by 8 stride, padding is "SAME"
- Conv2D: stride 1, padding is "SAME"
- ReLU
- Max pool: Use a 4 by 4 filter size and a 4 by 4 stride, padding is "SAME"
- Flatten the previous output.
- FULLYCONNECTED (FC) layer: Apply a fully connected layer without an non-linear activation function. Do not call the softmax here. This will result in 6 neurons in the output layer, which then get passed later to a softmax. In TensorFlow, the softmax and cost function are lumped together into a single function, which you'll call in a different function when computing the cost.

Thus, I have built a model that recognizes sign language with almost 80% accuracy on the test set, and so we see, the cost value is decreasing by the iterations.
